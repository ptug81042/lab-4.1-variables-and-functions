# Lab 4.1: Variables and Functions

After completing this activity in JavaScript, take a few minutes to reflect on the following questions:
1. How did you approach creating more flexible functions with parameters?
   - I considered what values might change for each function and made those values parameters. This allowed the functions to handle a wider range of inputs and scenarios, making them reusable and adaptable.

2. What challenges did you face while incorporating conditional logic in your functions?
   - One challenge was ensuring that all possible invalid inputs were handled gracefully. I had to carefully check types and values to prevent unexpected behavior or errors, and provide clear feedback when inputs were invalid.

3. How does refactoring improve the readability and maintainability of your code?
   - Refactoring helps by organizing code into smaller, more focused functions and removing duplication. This makes the code easier to read, understand, and update in the future, as well as reducing the likelihood of errors.
